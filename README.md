This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Standard Create React App, with added:

-   styled components
-   styling reset to avoid those pesky default paddings
-   grid component ready to make some lovely layouts with
-   routing with react-router-dom
-   breakpoints based off of googles material design
-   clearer folder restructuring (to me at least anyway)
